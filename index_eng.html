										<h3 id="content">A little about my journey.</h3>
										<p>My name is <b>Deivison Morais</b>, I have a degree in civil production engineering and since 2010 I have been working in the area of appraisal and expertise engineering. However, at the end of 2018, when I read a <b>book</b>, completely by chance, my career transition process began <b>began</b>. Definitely, reading the book Industry 4.0 Concepts and Fundamentals was a great <b>turning point</b> in my life !! The awakening to all the great technological transformations that are taking place simultaneously since the beginning of the fourth industrial revolution made me look for a new professional and life purpose <b>purpose</b>.</p>
										<p>The idea that all evolution of a species occurs through a process of adaptation is unique. My natural path of <b>adaptation</b> was to seek more knowledge about this <b>new technological revolution</b> and so in March 2019 I started the MBA in Industry 4.0 at PUC-Minas, being, at the time, the first MBA course on this subject authorized in Brazil. </p>
										<p>The <b>MBA</b> offered an excellent overview of the fundamental pillars of <b>Industry 4.0</b> and the ones that most caught my attention were <b>artificial intelligence and big data analytics</b>. After finishing the course in June 2020, I realized that my <b>vocation</b> and my natural path was to continue delving into these two areas and that's where I found <b>data science</b> as my new profession.</p>
										<p>Since 2020 I have been preparing and building this new chapter of my career. During this <b>transformation process</b> the journey has been incredible, which makes me sure why I became a <b>data scientist</b>.</p>

											<h2 id="content">3+ Complete professional projects in data science</h2>
											<p>Elaboration of data solutions for business problems, <b>simulating real world challenges</b>, using public data from Data Science competitions. The projects were built from the analytical interpretation of the problem, through the structuring and execution of the business solution to the publication of the algorithm trained in production, using Cloud Computing tools.</p>
											<p>Regarding the execution of these projects, it is noteworthy that statistical techniques were used to analyze the data, as well as the use of machine learning models to solve business problems. A detailed description of each of these projects can be found in the next section of this portfolio.</p>

														<h3>Hard Skills Appraisal and Expertise Engineering</h3>
														<p>I would like to highlight that throughout my career I have acquired experience in the preparation of technical reports for the <b>patrimonial evaluation</b> of urban and rural properties inserted in the area of influence of infrastructure projects (roads, railways, pipelines).</p>
														<p>During my professional practice I also worked carrying out <b>economic evaluations</b> of commercial establishments subject to expropriation (Calculating Trade Fund and Business Interruption), whose main objective is to facilitate <b>strategic decision-making</b> in projects involving large areas to be expropriated. In the article <a href="https://github.com/deivison1983/portfolio_projetos/blob/main/AO-33-A-Import%C3%A2ncia-das-Avalia%C3%A7%C3%B5es-Econ%C3%B4micas-no-Estudo-de-Viabilidade.pdf">"A Importância das Avaliações Econômicas no Estudo de Viabilidade para Projetos que Envolvam Desapropriações em Áreas Urbanas"</a> presented at the <b>XX COBREAP</b> (XX Brazilian Congress of Assessment and Expertise Engineering) I detail through a case study one of the projects of this nature in the which I worked.</p>
														<p>I participated in the team of evaluating engineers of the consulting company that was assisting the Renova Foundation in the calculation of the patrimonial and economic indemnities of those impacted by the <b>failure of the Fundão dam</b> of Mineradora Samarco in Mariana-MG in 2015. Due to the nature of the multiple impacts resulting from of the event over 40 municipalities I was able to work with evaluations of the most varied types, which I can highlight with a  <b>unique experience</b>.</p>
														<p>During my professional development process, I carried out technical inspections and inspections for different purposes in new, old or under construction buildings. In addition, I worked in risk engineering, identifying situations that could put the safety of users and assets at risk.</p>
													</div>
													<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
														<h3>Soft Skills Appraisal and Expertise Engineering</h3>
														<p>Experience in <b>technical coordination</b> of service contracts for land management sectors of large mining companies. In performing this role, I had to interact with several internal and external <b>stakeholders</b> simultaneously, which is very challenging professionally.</p>
														<p>Among the various <b>responsibilities</b> with internal stakeholders, I mention organizing and planning the work flow of the teams in the field and office in view of the established deadline, quality and cost, training and qualifying new employees, managing people, responding to the board in view of the goals and results.</p>
														<p>With regard to external stakeholders, I emphasize that I was responsible for assisting analysts, coordinators and managers, <b>developing</b> new technical products adjusted to meet specific issues, agreeing deadlines for delivery and performance of services, presenting results, coordinating fieldwork in communities impacted by the mining activity.</p>
														<p>The works of an expert area demand answering several types of questions, among which I highlight: What is this problem in my building? What is the cause of this infiltration in my apartment? Do these fissures and cracks put my physical or property security at risk? How much does it cost to fix the problem? To answer these questions, it is necessary for the professional to have the <b>analytical capacity</b> to observe a particular problem situation and build a reasoned analysis of the origin and possible cause and effect relationship on the fact to be clarified. In addition, all the work is formalized through the <b>writing</b> of a technical report that needs to be understood by people who are laymen in engineering.</p>

											<h3>Sales forecast - Rossmann Drugstores.</h3>
											<p>This project, which forms part of my professional portfolio, seeks to create a business solution that will help the CEO of Rossmann, one of the largest drugstore chains in Europe, to define which stores should be renovated depending on revenue.<br />I developed a machine learning model in production capable of predicting store sales in the next 6 weeks. In addition, a bot was made available to the CEO in the Telegram application capable of accessing the model in production, so that the CEO can get the sales forecasts of the stores in the palm of his hand.</p>

											<h3>Property Valuation Project in King County, Washington, USA.</h3>
											<p>This project aims to create a business solution that will help the King County government make better decisions regarding the expropriation process of properties that may be directly impacted by new infrastructure projects.<br /> I developed two data products, being a machine learning model capable of calculating the market value of a property, as well as a dashboard with the analysis if the prices offered by real estate agencies in the county are in accordance with the real market value.<br /> If these two products were used, the King County government would reduce its project cost and could make faster strategic decisions about the economic viability of new infrastructure projects.</p>

											<h3>Health Insurance Cross Sell Project.</h3>
											<p>This project seeks to create a business solution that will help a health insurance company to define which customers should be selected to receive an offer to launch a new service, vehicle insurance. The board established that the previous year's customer database should be used as a data source, as a survey on the intention to take out vehicle insurance was carried out with these policyholders. <br />Based on historical customer data and research on the intention to take out vehicle insurance, I developed a machine learning model capable of sorting a list of 127,000 new customers in view of the greater probability of taking out insurance.<br /> </p>
